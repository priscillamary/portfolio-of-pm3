    <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <h4>This is what my life really looks like, and although past-me used to be more "well-rounded",
        past-me would worry about anything and everything. Past-me also hadn't found her interest in Computer Science yet...
        - all the more reason to enjoy the start of my programming journey! I got into coding when I first started Girls Who
        Code at JP Morgan Chase & Co. here in Jersey City, NJ as a part of the Summer Immersion Program. I absolutely love
        the program, the other girls, the teaching environment, the culture of JPMC, and most importantly - the compsci of it all.
        I cannot begin to say, really, how much this program has turned my whole life around in a whole 360. I now have opportunities
        and priceless connections/information with/from GWC girls, instructors, and speakers. I want to share my progress and
        personality with you all through this website - a grand project containing smaller ones. "What My Life Really
        Looks Like" is a reality I can say I have no worries about, but will not accept as enough. An "ideal life" would mean everything
        is equal in personal significance and meaning, hence a balanced life, but is this really the ideal life? I don't think so.
        In an "ideal" world, everything would be meaningless and have no weight/substance BECAUSE of the equal importance. As a student,
        even I know "ideal" is impossible to achieve, but I guess I've learned to priortize and purposely be great at one thing that I
        absolutely love rather than being well-rounded. I guess I'm just always thinking about ways to improve myself and help others
        (in that order). That "hungry" mindset, I can say, is the only thing I accept.
        I'm simply a work in progress...</h4>
